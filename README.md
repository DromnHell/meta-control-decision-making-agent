# meta-control-experiment


This program is the one I developed during my thesis: "Generic cognitive architecture for the coordination of learning strategies in robotics". It allows to perform learning tasks in fictitious environments represented by a probabilistic and discrete model that describes what happens when the agent acts in the environment.

The main objective of my thesis was to create a meta-control algorithm that allows an agent to coordinate several online behavior strategies. This program allowed me to quickly evaluate several coordination criteria in simulation before performing experiments in the real environment with a real robot.
